# ENet Connect

## What is ENet Connect?

ENet Connect is a Network as a Service/Software as a Service (NaaS) base fully-managed multi-tenant, transport-agnostic, cloud based SD-WAN platform designed for Enterprise Customer and Managed Services Providers.

<u>Enterprises</u>

Enable enterprises the transition to SD-WAN, offering, network visibility, topology, centralized policy management and configuration, Zero Touch Configuration. 

<u>Ecosystem Partners</u>

Enable ecosytem partner to deploy SD-WAN for their customers without upfront cost that usually required when deploying new technology and services.

## ENet Connect Components

The primary components of the ENet Connect solution comprise of the following:

- **ENet Connect Orchestrator** - Central management of routing, policy, security, segmentation, and authentication of devices, initial authentication and authorization. Provides information on how each of the components (ECR) connects to other components (ECR, uCPE), and a centralized dashboard for configuration and management

- **Elastic Cloud Router (ECR)** - Elastic Cloud Router - ECR enable enterprises with virtual routing capabilities for public or private connectivity at Layer 3 from key datacenter within China, and key locations in Asia Pacific.

  Without physical infrastructure, you can leverage cloud to cloud networking, private peering between leading public Cloud providers, and secure connectivity to any ECR enabled datacenter. Enterprises are not longer required to own and maintain colocated equipment. ECR takes the complexity out of getting connected at Layer 3 and enable new possibilities for virtualised elastic networking.

  <u>ECRs are available in:</u>

  2Mbps, 4Mbps, 6Mbps, 8Mbps, 10Mbps, 20Mbps, 30Mbps, 50Mbps, 100Mbps, 200Mbps and 500Mbps options

- **universal Customer Premise Edge (uCPE)** - Full-featured IP Edge routers that perform standard functions such as BGP, OSPF, ACLs, QoS, and various routing policies in addition to the overlay communication.

#### <u>Supported Devices</u>

Universal Customer Edges devices are merchant silicon based networking appliances based on MIPs and/or x86 processors.
